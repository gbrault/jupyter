testing Jupyter Lab and git and gitpod

to run in gitpod

- click on gitpod when in github
- till run.sh is not in execute mode you need to do it manually (you can do so from gitpod and push changes)
- chmod +x run.sh
- cp -r /workspace/jupyter/.jupyter /home/gitpod/
- jupyter notebook (enter the GUID into the opening browser)

[Go to gitpod dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/){:target="_blank"} **to check if an image is already there**
